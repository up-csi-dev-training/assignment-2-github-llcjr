Tame Impala - Borderline

Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time for somethin'
How was I to know?
How was I to know this high came rushing?

We're on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Possibly a sign
I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday

There I go
Quite a show for a loner in L.A.
Askin' how I managed to end up in this place
And I couldn't get away

We're on the borderline
Dangerously far and all forgiven
There's gonna be a fight
Gonna be a price to pay on Monday
(If you and I get comfortable)
We're on the borderline (on the borderline)
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time (saw the time)
Watched it speedin' by like a train
Like a train

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Set it free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
If there's room, room for doubt
As within, as without ya
Will I be so in love?
Gettin' closer, close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P. here comes the sun
Here comes the sun

Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
How could I have known?
How was I to know this life get no shame
I said, "Come with me outside"
I need to clear my mind
This weight is crushing
Do you see the light, oh
Coming from their eyes, oh no
And I couldn't get away

We're on the borderline
Gets me every time
These close encounters
Just to know I can (just to know I can)
Once again, I am alone

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Set it free, must be tough (I was fine without ya)
Will I be known and loved?
L.A. really messed me up
And it isn't cut and dry
Conversation, well I tried (I was fine without ya)
Will I be? Stay right here
Any closer, bad idea
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P. here comes the sun (I was fine without ya)
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?

"Borderline" is a song by the Australian psychedelic music project Tame Impala.
It is the third track on the 2020 studio album The Slow Rush, and was released as a single on 12 April 2019 through Modular Recordings.
The song was written by Kevin Parker, who performed all instruments and vocals. The song was influenced by yacht rock and disco, and the lyrics explore nihilism and insecurity.
It was debuted during the band's performance on Saturday Night Live on 30 March; Parker ad-libbed much of the initial lyrics since he had not yet finalised them.
